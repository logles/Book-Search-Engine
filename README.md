## Description

Most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This project is a **Book Search Engine** that was originally built as a fully functioning Google Books API search engine using a RESTful API. It has now been refactored to leverage a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The application is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and allows users to search for books, save their favorite titles, and manage their personal collection. This upgrade improves performance, scalability, and maintainability.
